# Reall3dViewer

`Reall3dViewer` is a 3D Gaussian Splatting viewer built on Three.js. Crafting an exceptional 3DGS viewer is no small feat, which is why we've chosen to open-source our project. We hope to harness the collective wisdom and efforts of the community to drive the advancement of 3DGS applications together!

## Features
- [x] Support formats: `.ply`, `.splat`, `.spx`, `.spz`
- [x] Support mark and measurement
- [x] Support text watermark
- [x] Support 1st to 3nd degree spherical harmonics


## Live demo
https://reall3d.com/reall3dviewer/index.html


## `.spx`

- Format Specification: https://github.com/reall3d-com/Reall3dViewer/blob/main/SPX_EN.md
- Conversion Tool: https://github.com/gotoeasy/gsbox

## Basic Usage
```shell
# develop
npm run dev

# build
npm run build

# open a web browser to render your 3dgs model
# http://hostname:port/index.html?url=your-model-link-address

# .spx file can be obtained through conversion using the gsbox
gsbox p2x -i /path/to/input.ply -o /path/to/output.spx -sh 0
```

## TODO
- Continuously optimize and enhance rendering performance
- Large scene
- 3DGS in MAP
